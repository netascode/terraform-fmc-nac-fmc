# FMC Network Group Object Example

This example will create a new `MyNetworkGroup1`, `MyNetworkGroup2` network-group objects that contains two objects:
> `MyNetworkGroup1`:
- newly created `MyHost1` host object
- already existing `any-ipv4` network object
> `MyNetworkGroup2`:
- newly created `MyNetworkGroup1` network-group object
- newly created `MyHost2` host object


Set environment variables pointing to FMC:

```bash
export FMC_USERNAME=<username>
export FMC_PASSWORD=<password>
export FMC_HOST=<hostname>
(Optionally)
export FMC_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true
```

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example will create resources. Resources can be destroyed with `terraform destroy`.
